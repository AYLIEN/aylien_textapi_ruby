      string: ! "{\n  \"text\": \"The Super-Slim Kindle Voyage Is A Great Travel Companion\\nIn
        1935, Sir Allen Lane and V. K. Krishna Menon founded Penguin Books, a company
        dedicated to producing high-quality, small-format paperback books for the
        world market. These small, well-made little books introduced some amazing
        fiction, philosophy, classical thought and spiritualism to a hungry audience,
        and the low price made it easy to build a library of amazing titles that could
        fit into a milk crate. Penguin, it can be argued, brought about an intellectual
        sea change, bringing us both the post-war writers of note and, in another
        direction, the Beats and the spiritual riot of the 1960s.\\n\\nWhy was Penguin
        so popular? And why is the 6-inch Kindle Voyage its emotional successor? Both
        revolutionized the physical notion of books.\\n\\nIn Penguin\\u2019s case,
        the medium was truly the message, and\\u00a0the writing inside the small,
        pocketable books allowed for portability and encouraged collection. In the
        Kindle Voyage\\u2019s case, Amazon has created a delightful travel companion.\\n\\nFirst,
        let\\u2019s address the size. The $199 Voyage ($219 without ads and with 3G)
        is about as big as a Penguin paperback and just a bit bigger (and thicker)
        than a standard passport. It\\u2019s 7.6 mm thick and removed from its case
        it looks about as substantial as a thin stack of paper.\\n\\nThe Voyage is
        the Kindle distilled. Almost all of the features are there \\u2013 touchscreen,
        bright white e-ink display, and even a special haptic feedback system that
        allows you to \\u201cclick\\u201d left and right side buttons to turn pages.
        You can also swipe the page left and right to move to the next page and small
        dedicated spots above the longer touch-sensitive pads that go back one page.\\n\\nAmazon
        sells an $45 folding case for the Voyage that opens up like a Moleskine reporter\\u2019s
        notebook. It activates the Kindle upon opening and turns it off when closed.
        Hidden magnets then allow you to turn the cover into a little stand for hands-free
        reading.\\n\\nSo how does it work? In short, I love e-ink devices, and the
        Voyage is the best of them. Because it lasts for weeks \\u2013 I haven\\u2019t
        charged it in a full week of use \\u2013 you can stick it in a bag or backpack
        and expect it to be ready to read. The bright backlit screen casts a gentle
        glow that is reactive to outside light and makes reading pleasant without
        the glare of LCD. As a dedicated e-reader, it is nearly perfect, and I rarely
        say anything in CE is perfect.\\n\\nWho is this for? It\\u2019s for readers.
        The Voyage doesn\\u2019t do much except display books and allow you to buy
        them. You can download thousands of titles and not run out of space and, thanks
        to new organizational systems, you can place books into folders and control
        their placement on the device. But, again, it\\u2019s for readers. Don\\u2019t
        expect to read email, browse the web, or control your home security system
        from this device. It\\u2019s the e-reader perfected, however, and that means
        a lot.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t know how much longer the market for dedicated e-readers
        will exist, but I certainly appreciate Amazon\\u2019s dedication to the cause.
        E-ink devices are special because they\\u2019re amazingly readable and light
        and have great battery life. All of these aspects work in concert to offer
        a reading experience akin to thumbing through a Penguin Classic.\\n\\nAgain,
        this isn\\u2019t for everyone. It\\u2019s great for travel \\u2013 I took
        it with me to Disrupt in Europe and have read it on planes for the past few
        days \\u2013 and it\\u2019s great for people who don\\u2019t want a distracting
        reading experience. It\\u2019s a great gateway tablet, for example, for folks
        who don\\u2019t want a complex experience and instead just want to read. It\\u2019s
        also far more comfortable on the eyes for night reading in bed and the text
        can be modified for any eyes.\\n\\nAmazon is aiming for readers. It knows
        that people love Kindles because they are pure products for reading. And the
        Voyage is Amazon\\u2019s latest attempt at perfecting the e-book. Not unlike
        Penguin, Amazon looked at the market and made a bold move. It\\u2019s paid
        off and the resulting products \\u2013 the Fire like and this new Kindle \\u2013
        are nearly perfect media consumption devices by a company that knows how to
        sell.\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"categories\": [{\n    \"label\": \"economy,
