        aircraft leasing and financing arm has confirmed that it has placed an order
        for 40 Boeing planes worth $4bn (\u00a32.3bn) at list prices.\n\nThe order
        was booked last year, but so far had been attributed to an \"unidentified
        customer\" by Boeing.\n\nGE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) said the new
        planes would help it meet growing demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft
        from its customers.\n\n\"Our airline customers require more fuel-efficient
        aircraft to compete in the marketplace,\" Norman CT Liu, chief executive of
        GECAS, said in a statement.\n\nGECAS has now placed total orders for 95 units
        of 737 MAX 8 airplanes and 387 of the next-generation 737-800 jets making
        it the biggest buyer of the two models in the leasing industry.\n\nA slowdown
        in global travel demand, coupled with high fuel prices, has hurt the profitability
        of many airlines across the globe in recent years.\n\nAs a result, airlines
        have been looking to keep their costs in check to try and sustain their profitability.\n\nThat
        has in turn caused a rise in demand for fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\nThe 100-200
        seat narrow-body - or single-aisle - aircraft market is forecast to generate
        $20 trillion (\u00a312.8tn) over the next 20 years.\n\nThe sector is currently
        dominated by Airbus''s A320 and Boeing''s 737 aircraft, but other firms are
        also looking to tap into the market.\n\nBoeing has claimed that its next-generation
        737''s offer the \"lowest operating costs in its class\".","language":"en","concepts":{"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connecticut":{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"CT","score":0.7768695300895874,"offset":538}],"types":["http://schema.org/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Region","http://schema.org/AdministrativeArea","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/AdministrativeRegion"],"support":22055},"http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_Electric":{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"GE","score":0.9908060693929266,"offset":32}],"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Device","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/InformationAppliance"],"support":4179},"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aircraft_lease":{"surfaceForms":[{"string":"aircraft
