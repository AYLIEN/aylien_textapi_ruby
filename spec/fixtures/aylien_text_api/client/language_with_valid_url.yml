        to be a target for French side Paris St-Germain.\\u00a0\\nMessi making chances\\nLionel
        Messi has created 36 chances for Barcelona this season and has been on the
        winning side in 16 of the 20 games he has played\\nIn an interview with radio
        station RAC1, posted on Barcelona's website,\\u00a0 Bartomeu said: \\\"The
        club will sit down and negotiate a new contract.\\n\\\"We will do what we
        have to, to ensure he's the best-paid player.\\\"\\nMessi scored 60 goals
        in 50 appearances last season but has struggled to match that goalscoring
        form in 2013-14.\\nHe has scored 18 goals so far but just eight of those have
        been in the league.\\nHis last league goal came in September, before he was
        out for five weeks with a hamstring injury.\\n\\\"He can do everything,\\\"
        said Barca coach Gerardo Martino. \\\"If he succeeds in other facets of his
        game, it doesn't matter if he scores.\\n\\\"Nothing surprises me with him.
        He controls the game well, passes the ball well, he is a good finisher, he
        can press and recover the ball.\\n\\\"He sees passes that most people can
        only see whilst watching the game on TV or in the stands, not ones that you
        can normally see on the field.\\\"\\nAlso related to this story\\n\",\n  \"lang\":
